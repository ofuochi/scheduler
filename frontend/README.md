# Overview

This is the UI for the task scheduler. Note that I didn't have enough time to complete unit and e2e test for the UI

## How to run

To run the app, follow the instructions below

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# start the application
yarn start
```

I've set the default backend url in the `.env`, you may change it to match the url and port of the backend server
